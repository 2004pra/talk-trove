What I Learned Through This Project
Web Sockets and Socket.IO: I gained hands-on experience with Web Sockets and their implementation using Socket.io. This included broadcasting messages to multiple clients, handling various events, implementing acknowledgments, and managing disconnect and error events.
Context API: I learned how to use the Context API in React to manage global state and share data between components without the need for prop drilling.
UI with Chakra UI: I developed a user-friendly UI design using Chakra UI, enhancing the overall user experience of the application.
